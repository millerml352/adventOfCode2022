# adventOfCode2022
Tracking my progress on Advent of Code 2022, working in Python, attempting to try new things as I'm sure will be needed to complete all challenges
Recording something below for each day that was at least relatively new to me
1. nested for loops written as one line comprehension
2. match case statement
3. dictionary to assign priority values to characters
4. list comprehension statement to determine range overlap
